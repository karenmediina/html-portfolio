<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an undergrad at Stanford studying CS. I love learning, genuinely. This is my cute little
  About me section. So I can rant. </p>

<p>I'm from Puerto Rico and ever since I left the island I've come to love it even more. I know that happens often to people that
  go study abroad and even though I'm technically not an international student, cultures and living styles are very different. I'm 
  back home for this summer (2024) and I've been loving it. What's to come isn't set in stone but I hope I always get the chance to come 
  back to my island every once in a while. There are beautiful things here including my wonderful wonderful friends.
</p>

<p>More on the academic side, I'm into a bunch of things I think. I'm practicing not being scared of trying new things that pique my interest
  even if I don't commit to it for the rest of my life. I would love to have a positive impact and I'm definitely working towards that too.

  I'm a QB scholar, two time ISEF finalist, and most recently Professional Director for SOLE and VP of Marketing for SWITE. 
  Having left my roles of president of our math club and programming club... I'm exploring new fields and helping as many people as
  I can along the way. yujuju que emocion.
